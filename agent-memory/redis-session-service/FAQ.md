### Q1: How can I connect to Memorystore for Redis from Cloud Run?

**A:** Since Cloud Run is a serverless environment and Memorystore for Redis is created with a private IP inside a VPC, they cannot communicate directly. To connect them, you must use a **Serverless VPC Access Connector**.

The overall process is as follows:

1.  **Create a Memorystore for Redis instance**: Prepare a Redis instance within a VPC network.
2.  **Create a Serverless VPC Access Connector**: Create a connector in the same VPC network as Redis. This connector acts as a bridge between Cloud Run and the VPC.
3.  **Deploy the Cloud Run service**: When deploying or updating the Cloud Run service, configure it to connect to the created VPC connector.
4.  **Modify the application code**: Implement the application code to connect to Redis using its private IP address and port information, typically passed via environment variables.

### Q2: How should the network for Cloud Run be configured to connect to Memorystore for Redis?

**A:** You need to configure the **outbound (Egress) traffic** settings of the Cloud Run service to be directed to the VPC network.

1.  **Connect the VPC Connector**:
    - In the 'Networking' tab of your Cloud Run service settings, **connect the VPC connector** that you previously created in the same VPC as Memorystore.
    - In the `gcloud` CLI, use the `--vpc-connector` flag.

2.  **Configure VPC Egress (Traffic Routing) (Recommended)**:
    - Select the option **'Route only requests to private IPs to the VPC connector'** (`private-ranges-only`).
    - This setting is the most efficient, as it only sends traffic destined for internal IPs (like Memorystore) through the VPC connector, while traffic to the public internet goes out directly.
    - In the `gcloud` CLI, use the `--vpc-egress=private-ranges-only` flag.

**gcloud command example:**
```bash
gcloud run deploy [SERVICE_NAME] \
  --image=[IMAGE_URL] \
  --region=[REGION] \
  --vpc-connector=[CONNECTOR_NAME] \
  --vpc-egress=private-ranges-only \
  --set-env-vars REDIS_HOST=[REDIS_IP_ADDRESS],REDIS_PORT=[REDIS_PORT]
```

### Q3: How do I create a Memorystore for Redis (Valkey) instance using the `gcloud` CLI?

**A:** You can create a basic Memorystore for Redis instance using the following `gcloud` command.

```bash
gcloud redis instances create my-redis-instance \
    --size=1 \
    --region=us-central1 \
    --tier=BASIC \
    --redis-version=REDIS_7_2 \
    --network=default
```

- **`my-redis-instance`**: The name of the instance to create.
- **`--size`**: Memory size in GB.
- **`--region`**: The GCP region where the instance will be created.
- **`--tier`**: `BASIC` (standalone) or `STANDARD_HA` (high availability).
- **`--redis-version`**: The Redis version.
- **`--network`**: The VPC network to connect to (default: `default`).

### Q4: Is the Memorystore for Redis instance created by the [command in Q3](#q3-how-do-i-create-a-memorystore-for-redis-valkey-instance-using-the-gcloud-cli) installed in a Private Subnet?

**A:** Yes, that's correct. Memorystore for Redis is always created with a **private IP address** within a VPC network. It is not directly exposed to the public internet, which has the same effect as being installed in a secure Private Subnet. Only resources within the same VPC network can access this instance via its internal IP.

---

### Q5: How can I check the information of a Memorystore for Redis instance using the `gcloud` CLI?

**A:** You can use the `gcloud redis instances describe` command to view the detailed information of a specific instance.

**Check a specific instance's information:**
```bash
# Replace [INSTANCE_NAME] and [REGION] with your actual values.
gcloud redis instances describe [INSTANCE_NAME] --region=[REGION]
```
Running this command will provide all the necessary connection information, including the instance's IP address (`host`), port (`port`), and VPC network (`authorizedNetwork`).

**List all instances in a project:**
```bash
# To see all instances in a specific region, use the --region flag.
gcloud redis instances list --region=[REGION]
```

### Q6: How do I connect a Cloud Run service using the [retrieved Memorystore for Redis information](#q5-how-can-i-check-the-information-of-a-memorystore-for-redis-instance-using-the-gcloud-cli)?

**A:** You can connect it through a 3-step process. The key is to configure Cloud Run to access the VPC network, as Redis uses a private IP.

**Step 1: Create a Serverless VPC Access Connector**
Create a connector to link Cloud Run and the VPC network where Redis is located. (Skip this step if you already have one.)
```bash
gcloud compute networks vpc-access connectors create redis-connector \
  --network default \
  --region us-central1 \
  --range "10.8.0.0/28"
```
*   The `--network` and `--region` must be set to the same values as your Redis instance.

**Step 2: Deploy Cloud Run with the VPC Connector and Environment Variables**
Use the `gcloud run deploy` command to attach the VPC connector and inject the Redis connection information as environment variables.
```bash
gcloud run deploy [SERVICE_NAME] \
  --image [IMAGE_NAME] \
  --region us-central1 \
  --vpc-connector redis-connector \
  --vpc-egress all-traffic \
  --set-env-vars REDIS_HOST=[REDIS_IP_ADDRESS],REDIS_PORT=[REDIS_PORT]
```
*   `--vpc-egress all-traffic`: This setting ensures that all outbound traffic from Cloud Run goes through the VPC, allowing it to access the private IP of Redis.
*   For `REDIS_HOST` and `REDIS_PORT`, enter the `host` and `port` values you obtained in **Q5**.

**Step 3: Use Environment Variables in Your Application Code**
Within your code, read the environment variables (`REDIS_HOST`, `REDIS_PORT`) to initialize the Redis client.

```python
# Python Example
import os
import redis

redis_host = os.environ.get('REDIS_HOST')
redis_port = int(os.environ.get('REDIS_PORT'))

redis_client = redis.Redis(host=redis_host, port=redis_port)
```

### Q7: Are separate firewall rule settings required to connect to Memorystore for Redis from Cloud Run?

**A:** No, generally **no additional firewall settings are needed.**

Google Cloud's `default` VPC network includes a default firewall rule called `default-allow-internal`, which permits communication between all resources within the VPC. Since Cloud Run acts like a component inside the VPC via the VPC connector, it can communicate with the Redis instance without any extra rules.

However, if you have modified the `default-allow-internal` rule or are using a custom VPC that lacks an internal communication rule, you may need to configure firewall rules yourself.
