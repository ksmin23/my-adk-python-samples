    "# RAG with Vertex AI Vector Search 2.0 (Agent Engine)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to interact with a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) agent that has been deployed to **Vertex AI Agent Engine**. It focuses on using the **Vertex AI Agent Development Kit (ADK)** capabilities to manage sessions and perform real-time streaming queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Features\n",
    "*   **Environment Configuration**: Quick setup for Project ID, Location, and Agent Engine identifiers.\n",
    "*   **Agent Engine Integration**: Connecting to a live `ReasoningEngine` resource deployed on Google Cloud.\n",
    "*   **Stateful Sessions**: Managing persistent conversation sessions to maintain context across multiple user turns.\n",
    "*   **Async Streaming**: Implementing asynchronous streaming queries for a responsive, \"typewriter-style\" user experience.\n",
    "*   **Resource Cleanup**: Guidance on managing and deleting reasoning engines to optimize cloud costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Prerequisites\n",
    "Before proceeding with this notebook, ensure you have:\n",
    "1.  Completed the data ingestion process into Vertex AI Vector Search 2.0.\n",
    "2.  Deployed your agent using the `adk deploy agent_engine` command.\n",
    "3.  Recorded the **Agent Engine ID** from your deployment summary."
