AlloyDB for PostgreSQL is a fully managed, PostgreSQL-compatible database service designed for demanding workloads, including hybrid transactional and analytical processing. It combines a Google-built database engine with a cloud-based, multi-node architecture to deliver enterprise-grade performance, reliability, and availability.

How AlloyDB Works

An application connects to AlloyDB instances using standard PostgreSQL protocols and techniques, and then uses PostgreSQL query syntax to work with the database. Under the surface, AlloyDB utilizes a cloud-based hierarchy of components and features designed to maximize data availability and optimize query performance and throughput. Google Cloud administrative tools allow you to monitor the health of your AlloyDB deployment, adjusting its scale and size to best fit the changing demands of your workload.

AlloyDB's Architectural Difference from Standard PostgreSQL

Traditional PostgreSQL deployments couple the database engine that processes queries with the storage where your data resides, often on the same server. AlloyDB employs a disaggregated architecture where the compute and storage layers are separate and offer individual scaling.

This disaggregated design, built on Google's distributed file system, offers several advantages:

- Independent scaling: You can scale your compute resources (nodes and instances) up or down based on query demands without provisioning or de-provisioning storage. You can also scale out read-only nodes for read scalability with no impact on availability. As your data grows, storage scales with no impact on compute.
- Enhanced performance: With an optimized cloud-native storage engine, AlloyDB provides fast transactional and analytical query performance, which results from intelligent caching layers and advanced I/O management.
- Simplified management: The separation of concerns enables automatic management of many database operations, including replication, backups, and patching, which are manual tasks in self-managed PostgreSQL.
- High availability and durability: Redundant data storage in the durable layer spans multiple availability zones, providing automatic failover and recovery without data loss, regardless of instance health.

This fundamental architectural difference manifests in AlloyDB's resource hierarchy using clusters as the overarching logical database containers, with nodes providing the computational power, and instances serving as the application connection points, all while data persists in a separate, disaggregated storage layer.

Key Features

AlloyDB distinguishes itself from a stock PostgreSQL installation in a number of ways beyond the vertical and horizontal scaling advantages inherent in the multi-node architecture described earlier. The following sections take a deeper look at key features of AlloyDB.

- Automatic and adaptive database features:
    - An index advisor helps you find opportunities to optimize your database schema using new indexes based on your usage patterns.
    - A columnar engine can accelerate the performance of analytical queries by storing data in memory using a columnar format. This lets AlloyDB use advanced processing techniques to efficiently scan a large amount of table data when needed.
    - An adaptive variation of the PostgreSQL stale-data autovacuum feature automatically adjusts vacuum-related parameters to best suit the shape of your workload.
    - Automatic memory and storage management systems take advantage of the Google-built, cloud-based environment that AlloyDB runs on, continuously allocating and releasing memory and storage as needed to keep your cluster running with optimal performance and resource efficiency.
- High availability: By default, an AlloyDB cluster offers availability (HA) through its primary instance's redundant nodes, located in two different zones, with automatic failover.
- Data backup and disaster recovery: AlloyDB features a continuous backup and recovery system that lets you create a new cluster based on any point in time within an adjustable retention period. This lets you recover quickly from data-loss accidents.
- Security and access control: You can configure a cluster to require connection with the secure AlloyDB Auth Proxy, which uses Google Cloud Identity and Access Management (IAM) for access control.
- Encryption: AlloyDB protects all data at rest using Google's encryption methods by default. If you instead need to encrypt your data using a key that you provide, then you can specify a customer-managed encryption key (CMEK) when creating a cluster.
- Non-disruptive maintenance: AlloyDB maintenance operations are designed to minimize disruptions to your database. Primary and secondary instances have a downtime of less than a second, while read pools remain continuously available with no downtime.
- Extension support: AlloyDB includes support for a number of popular PostgreSQL extensions.
- A self-hosted alternative: AlloyDB Omni: As an alternative to running AlloyDB within Google Cloud, Google offers AlloyDB Omni. This streamlined, downloadable edition of AlloyDB lets you run its powerful database engine on your own Linux-based computing environment, wherever that might be.
