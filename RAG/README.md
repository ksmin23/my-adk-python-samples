# RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Samples

This directory contains a collection of sample projects demonstrating various Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architectures using the Google Agent Development Kit (ADK) and different Google Cloud services for vector storage and retrieval.

## Projects

Here is a list of the available RAG sample projects:

### 1. Using Vertex AI RAG Engine

These samples leverage the fully managed Vertex AI RAG Engine, which simplifies the retrieval process.

-   **[RAG Engine with Managed DB](./rag-engine-with-managed-db/)**
    -   **Description**: Implements an Agentic RAG application using the Vertex AI RAG Engine with its own fully managed database. This is the simplest approach, as it doesn't require managing a separate Vector Search index.
    -   **Vector Store**: Vertex AI RAG Engine's Managed Database.

-   **[RAG Engine with Vector Search](./rag-engine-with-vectorsearch/)**
    -   **Description**: Implements an Agentic RAG application using the Vertex AI RAG Engine backed by a Vertex AI Vector Search index for efficient, scalable document retrieval.
    -   **Vector Store**: Vertex AI Vector Search.

### 2. Using Managed Databases with Vector Search Capabilities

These samples demonstrate how to build RAG applications by integrating directly with Google Cloud's managed databases that support vector search.

-   **[RAG with AlloyDB](./rag-with-alloydb/)**
    -   **Description**: An Agentic RAG implementation using the vector search feature of AlloyDB for PostgreSQL.
    -   **Vector Store**: AlloyDB for PostgreSQL.

-   **[RAG with BigQuery](./rag-with-bigquery/)**
    -   **Description**: An Agentic RAG implementation using BigQuery Vector Search.
    -   **Vector Store**: BigQuery.

-   **[RAG with Spanner](./rag-with-spanner/)**
    -   **Description**: An Agentic RAG implementation using the vector search feature of Google Cloud Spanner.
    -   **Vector Store**: Cloud Spanner.

### 3. Using Vertex AI Vector Search with a Separate Document Store

These samples showcase an architecture where Vertex AI Vector Search is used as a dedicated vector store for similarity searches, while a separate database or storage service holds the original documents.

-   **[RAG with Vector Search and Datastore](./rag-with-vectorsearch-ds/)**
    -   **Description**: An Agentic RAG implementation using Vertex AI Vector Search for vector retrieval and Firestore in Datastore mode as the document store.
    -   **Vector Store**: Vertex AI Vector Search.
    -   **Document Store**: Firestore (Datastore mode).

-   **[RAG with Vector Search and GCS](./rag-with-vectorsearch-gcs/)**
    -   **Description**: An Agentic RAG implementation using Vertex AI Vector Search for vector retrieval and Google Cloud Storage (GCS) as the document store.
    -   **Vector Store**: Vertex AI Vector Search.
    -   **Document Store**: Google Cloud Storage.
