# MCP (Model Context Protocol)

MCP is an open standard that standardizes how Large Language Models (LLMs) communicate with external systems. It acts as a universal connection mechanism, simplifying how LLMs get context, perform actions, and interact with various data sources and tools.

## Key Features

- **Standardized Communication:** Defines a universal protocol for LLMs to interact with external systems, eliminating the need for custom integrations.
- **Client-Server Architecture:** Utilizes a client-server model to expose data, interactive templates, and actionable functions.
- **Tool-Based Interaction:** Enables agents to consume external services and data sources as "tools".
- **ADK Integration:** The Agent Development Kit (ADK) provides comprehensive tools to both use and create MCP services.

## Use Cases

- **Database Access:** Allowing agents to query and interact with databases.
- **Generative Media Workflows:** Orchestrating complex workflows for creating images, videos, or other media.
- **Tool Exposure:** Exposing an application's functionalities as tools for other developers or agents to use.
